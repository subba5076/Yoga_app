Our project provides a simple, user-friendly interface to ensure that the 
user's experience while using the app is smooth. The user can select one 
of the yoga postures from the existing plans provided. Once the user has 
made their selection, they are redirected to the other activity, which 
includes instructions, a pictorial representation, and interactive audio 
instruction about the pose they have chosen. If the user is unsatisfied or 
wants to learn more about the asanas, they are free to opt for the premium 
plan. Once the payment is made, a verification will be sent to the user 
along with the login credentials to our website. The website consists of 
many advanced asanas, along with the audio-visual learning we provide 
online, one-on-one yoga training sessions, and diet plans too.
